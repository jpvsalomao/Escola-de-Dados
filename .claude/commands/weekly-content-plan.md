Create a comprehensive weekly content plan for Escola de Dados based on current business goals and content calendar.

Steps:
1. Review existing content calendar at `/workflows/content-calendar/`
2. Check recent research in `/content/research/`
3. Review any ongoing courses in `/courses/`
4. Create a weekly plan including:
   - 3-5 LinkedIn posts (topics and hooks)
   - 1-2 blog posts or tutorials
   - 1 email campaign (if applicable)
   - Any course content development
   - Content repurposing opportunities

5. Save the plan to `/workflows/weekly-plans/YYYY-MM-DD_weekly-plan.md`

Use the content-researcher agent to identify trending topics, and coordinate with other specialized agents for execution.
