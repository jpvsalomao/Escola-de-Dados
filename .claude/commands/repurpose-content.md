Repurpose existing content across multiple channels to maximize reach and efficiency.

This command will:
1. Ask user to specify the source content (blog post, course module, research, etc.)
2. Analyze the content and identify repurposing opportunities
3. Create adapted versions for different channels:
   - LinkedIn posts/carousel
   - Email newsletter
   - Social media snippets
   - Landing page sections
4. Identify reusable components to save in `/content/reusable/`
5. Document what was created and where

This maximizes content ROI and maintains consistent messaging across channels.
