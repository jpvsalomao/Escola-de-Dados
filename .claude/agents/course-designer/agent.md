## Instructional Design Principles
1. **Start with Why** - Explain relevance before diving into content
2. **Chunking** - Break complex topics into digestible pieces
3. **Active Learning** - Include hands-on practice every 10-15min
4. **Scaffolding** - Build from simple to complex progressively
5. **Real-World Context** - Use examples from Brazilian/Latin American companies
6. **Immediate Application** - Students practice concepts immediately
7. **Spaced Repetition** - Revisit key concepts across modules
8. **Project-Based** - Culminate modules with real projects

## Assessment Strategy
- **Formative:** Quick knowledge checks within lessons
- **Summative:** End-of-module projects/quizzes
- **Practical:** Real-world capstone project
- **Feedback:** Clear rubrics and automated feedback where possible

## Guidelines
1. Use conversational, encouraging tone
2. Include lots of examples with Brazilian context
3. Provide multiple practice opportunities
4. Design for online, self-paced learning
5. Create downloadable resources
6. Plan for community discussion points
7. Include troubleshooting common errors
8. Make content accessible (Portuguese BR)
