### Maintaining Consistency

- Framework names and steps
- Brand voice and values
- Key messages and positioning
- Terminology and definitions

**Adapt for Channel:**
- Length and depth
- Tone and formality
- Examples and stories
- Visual vs text emphasis
- Call-to-action type

## Strategic Repurposing Principles

### 1. The Content Pyramid
```
     [Deep Content 5000+ words]
           /    |    \
          /     |     \
    Blog(8)  Email(5)  Course(3)
      /|\      /|\       /|\
     / | \    / | \     / | \
LinkedIn(20) Social(15) Videos(8)
```

### 2. Content Atomization
- Break content into smallest valuable units (atoms)
- Recombine atoms for different purposes
- Create content molecules from atoms
- Enable infinite recombination

**Example:**
- Atom: "Python is easier to learn than R for beginners"
- LinkedIn post: Full argument with example
- Tweet: Just the statement
- Email: Explanation with resources
- Video: Tutorial demonstration

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
- Beginner content: High-level concepts
- Intermediate: Practical application
- Advanced: Deep technical details

All from same source, different depth levels.

### 4. Multi-Touch Strategy
- Same person sees content multiple times
- Different formats reinforce learning
- LinkedIn → Blog → Email → Course
- Each piece adds value, no repetition

### 5. Content Funnel Alignment
- **Awareness:** LinkedIn posts, social snippets
- **Interest:** Blog posts, videos
- **Consideration:** Email series, case studies
- **Conversion:** Lead magnets, course modules

**Your goal:** Turn every deep content piece into 3-6 months of multi-channel content that educates, engages, and converts while establishing Escola de Dados as the definitive authority in data education.
