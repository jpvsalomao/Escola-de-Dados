# Deep Content System Guide

## Overview

The Deep Content System is a comprehensive content multiplication engine that turns one piece of authoritative content into 50-80+ strategic pieces across multiple channels.

## System Components

### 1. Deep Content Writer Agent
**Location:** `.claude/agents/deep-content-writer/agent.md`

## How It Works

### The Content Multiplication Equation

```
1 Deep Content Piece (5000-10000 words)
         ↓
    Research (10+ sources, Brazilian data, case studies)
         ↓
    Writing (Original frameworks, comprehensive coverage)
         ↓
    Analysis (Extract insights, quotables, themes)
         ↓
    Repurposing (Adapt for channels and audiences)
         ↓
    50-80+ Strategic Pieces:
    - 15-20 LinkedIn posts
    - 8-12 blog posts
    - 5-7 email series
    - 3-5 course modules
    - 2-3 infographics
    - 5-8 video scripts
    - 10-15 social snippets
    - 2-3 lead magnets
         ↓
    3-6 Months of Multi-Channel Content
```

### The Content Pyramid

```
                [Deep Content]
                 5000+ words
                     │
          ┌──────────┼──────────┐
          │          │          │
       [Blog]    [Email]    [Course]
      8-12 posts  5-7 emails  3-5 modules
          │          │          │
    ┌─────┼─────┬────┼────┬─────┼─────┐
    │     │     │    │    │     │     │
[LinkedIn]  [Social] [Videos] [Infographics]
15-20 posts 15 pieces 5-8 scripts  2-3 designs
```

Each level adapts the content above it for specific purposes, audiences, and channels.

## Content Strategy

### Topic Selection Framework

Before creating deep content, validate:

#### 1. Customer Fit (Essential)

- Will this help them achieve their goals?
- Is this relevant to their journey stage?

**Check:** `/references/audience-research/target-customer-profile.md`

#### 2. Trending/Popular (Important)
- Is there search volume for this topic?
- Is it trending or evergreen important?

### Content Adaptation Principles

#### Same Core, Different Wrapper

**The Core (stays consistent):**
- Facts and data
- Key insights
- Framework steps
- Brand voice
- Core message

**The Wrapper (adapts):**
- Length (LinkedIn 1500 char vs blog 2000 words)
- Depth (beginner vs advanced)
- Format (text vs video vs visual)
- Tone (professional vs casual)
- Call-to-action (channel appropriate)

#### Progressive Disclosure

From same source, create:

**Beginner version:**
- High-level concepts
- Simple language
- Basic examples
- Lots of context

**Intermediate version:**
- Practical application
- Real-world scenarios
- Tool usage
- Implementation details

**Advanced version:**
- Edge cases
- Optimization
- Best practices
- Technical depth

All from the same deep content, adapted for skill level.

### Content Atomization

Break content into smallest valuable units ("atoms"):

**Example Atom:** "Python has a gentler learning curve than R for beginners"

**Repurpose as:**
- LinkedIn post: Full argument with example
- Tweet: Just the statement
- Email: Explanation with resources
- Video: Tutorial demonstration
- Infographic: Comparison chart
- Blog: Expanded with data

**Result:** One insight → 6+ pieces

## Operational Guidelines

### Weekly Rhythm

**If creating deep content:**
- Mon-Tue: Research and planning
- Wed-Thu: Writing
- Fri: Review and refinement
- Repeat for 2-3 weeks

**If repurposing:**
- Mon: Analyze content, create plan
- Tue-Thu: Create repurposed pieces (5-10 per week)
- Fri: Review, schedule, plan next week
- Repeat for 4-6 weeks

### Monthly Strategy

**Week 1:** Plan deep content topics, validate
**Week 2-3:** Create deep content OR execute repurposing
**Week 4:** Analyze performance, plan next month

**Result:** 1-2 deep pieces per quarter + continuous repurposing

✅ **Update regularly** - Keep evergreen content fresh
✅ **Think ecosystem** - How pieces connect and reinforce

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't rush** - Quality over speed for deep content
❌ **Don't just excerpt** - Repurposing adapts, not just cuts
❌ **Don't ignore data** - Double down on what performs
❌ **Don't create in isolation** - Consider customer journey
❌ **Don't forget Brazilian context** - Always localize
❌ **Don't skip the repurposing map** - Plan multiplication upfront

## Troubleshooting

### "Deep content isn't getting enough traffic"

**Solutions:**
- Check keyword research and SEO optimization
- Promote through repurposed pieces (LinkedIn, email)
- Build backlinks strategically
- Update with fresh data to boost rankings
- Create more comprehensive FAQ section

### "Repurposed content feels repetitive"

**Solutions:**
- Change the angle, not just the length
- Address different audience levels
- Use different frameworks (list vs story vs data)
- Combine atoms differently
- Add channel-specific value

### "Can't reach 50+ pieces from one source"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure deep content is comprehensive enough (5000+ words)
- Think multi-level (beginner/intermediate/advanced versions)
- Consider all channels (not just blog and LinkedIn)
- Include micro-content (social snippets, quote cards)
- Break down frameworks into step-by-step pieces

### "Takes too long to create deep content"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure proper research upfront (saves rewriting)
- Use content-researcher agent first
- Create detailed outline before writing
- Focus on one deep piece per month (quality over quantity)
- Consider "deep enough" (3000 words) vs. "deepest possible" (10000 words)

## Examples & Case Studies

*[As we create deep content, document case studies here]*

### Example Structure:

**Topic:** "Complete Guide to Python for Data Analysis"
- **Word Count:** 7,500
- **Research Time:** 5 days
- **Writing Time:** 10 days
- **Repurposed Into:** 68 pieces
  - 18 LinkedIn posts
  - 12 blog posts
  - 7 email series
  - 5 course modules
  - 3 infographics
  - 8 video scripts
  - 15 social snippets
- **Results:**
  - 15,000 organic visits in 3 months

**Remember:** The Deep Content System is about working smarter, not harder. Invest deeply in creating one authoritative piece, then systematically extract maximum value through strategic repurposing. One sprint = months of high-quality, multi-channel content.
